# OnionSproutsBot

Telegram bot for delivering The Tor Project's software to people in sensitive geographical areas.

## Development status

**This project is currently in early development stages and is currently merely conceptual.**

Due to Telegram's 50 MB limit on files sent by bots, it's best to work on a more stripped down version that just provides mirrors until further notice.
