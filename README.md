# OnionSproutsBot

Telegram bot for delivering The Tor Project's software to people in sensitive geographical areas.

## Development status

**This project is currently in early development stages and is currently merely conceptual.**

Due to Telegram's 50 MB limit on files sent by bots, the bot is currently undergoing a rewrite with a library that utilizes the MTProto protocol directly, in order to allow for sending files up to 2 GBs.

You can review and get involved in the latest discussions revolving around the development of the bot in the relevant [thread at The Tor Project's GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/gettor-project/trac/-/issues/22011).
