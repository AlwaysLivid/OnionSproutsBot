# TO-DO

This file contains a set of desired tasks that should be considered.

Please note that the [bot's source code](src/bot.py) contains a lot of additional notes that are more specific and represent design-related issues and thoughts at the time of authoring.

## Tasks

- Make strings translation-friendly.

- Add a language submenu to the Telegram bot, in order to allow people to easily switch between locales. Fetch the corresponding locale of the Tor browser, after asking the user whether using the currently selected locale is okay. If not, allow them to select the locale by themselves.

- Imitate the way gettor does logging.

- Improve user interface.
